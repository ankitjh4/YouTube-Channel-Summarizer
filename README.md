AI that watches every YouTube Video on a channel and gives you a notion Summary [WIP]

Roadmap 
1. Add support for videos that do not have subtitles enabled 
2. Add support for videos that are age restrcted 
3. Remove library dependencies and do everything locally. Some of these libraries are very small 
4. Convert to a CLI utility 

This is a beginer project. Please don't be too harsh :D
